% Let's do some thinking
% The main objective is to have an object that can be called.
% And visualized.
% The necessary attributes are:
% 1. Constructor
% 2. Dynamics 
% 3. Animate
% 
% I also have to keep in mind that I have a control variable 'r' that can
% release the robot.
% So that would be a part of the controls. 
% 
% So let's start with very basic object and go from there.
